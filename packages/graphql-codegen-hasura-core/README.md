# graphql-codegen-hasura-core

## Summary

This package contains core Types and supporting functions for the code generated by the suite of [graphql-codegen-hasura tools](https://github.com/ablestack/graphql-codegen-hasura)

## Instructions

This package should be referenced in the dependencies of the package.json of code consuming the [graphql-codegen-hasura](https://github.com/ablestack/graphql-codegen-hasura) generated code

## Motivation

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is a fantastic tool for the rapid development of a GraphQL backend. [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) is a suite of GraphQL tooling, including a great Client. [graphql-code-generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) is a fantastic code generation tool and library, to automate the generation of much of the boilerplate code required to use GraphQL. However, there still remained quite a bit of boiler plate code to be written.

The consistency and predictability of the Hasura](https://hasura.io/) GQL backend implementation, provided an opportunity to automate much of the remaining code for standard single-table mutations and queries, and multi-table helper code. This plugin is an attempt to do some of that.

## Disclaimers & Futher Information

This code was initially developed for use in a single separate commercial project. It is being shared in case useful to others, and as a contribution to the development community and the great GraphQL tools that already exist. The original implementation did just enough to meet the goals and needs of the initial project. There are many refinements and enhancements that would be beneficial - and contributions to that end are encouraged. See the associated [graphql-codegen-hasura GitHub repo](https://github.com/ablestack/graphql-codegen-hasura) for additional information.

## Note

This is development is not affiliated with either the [graphql-code-generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) team, the [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) team, or the [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) team.
